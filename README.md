# JavaImageFilter
Batch Image Filter

There are two methods in this class: 1. grayscale image filter; 2. inverted image filter. You may select a number of image files from your folder and run the methods. The new image file will be saved under a different name, like "gray-" + original-name, or "invert-" + original-name.
